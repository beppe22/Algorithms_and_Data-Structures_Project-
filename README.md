# Algorithms_and_Data-Structures_Project-
Efficient and correct implementation of an algorithm using just the libc with no threads and parallelisation. The system monitors several phenomena: new entities begin to be tracked, and existing entities stop being tracked. New relationships are established between monitored entities, and existing relationships are removed. Each entity has an identifying name. There can be different types of relationships between entities, each identified by a name. Each relationship has a direction making someone the "receiver" of the relationship. Upon a specific command, the system can return the entity that receives the most relationships for each relationship type. The result should be correct in term of result and in term of efficiency (response times and memory usage).
